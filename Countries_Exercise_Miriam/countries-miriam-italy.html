    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p>Italy is a country in Southern and Western Europe. It is located on a peninsula that extends into the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, with the Alps on its northern land border, as well as several islands, notably Sicily and Sardinia. Italy shares its borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia and two enclaves: Vatican City and San Marino. Its territory also includes Campione (an exclave surrounded by Switzerland) and the Pelagie Islands (an archipelago in the African Plate). It is the tenth-largest country by land area in the European continent, covering an area of 301,340 km2 (116,350 sq mi), and the third-most populous member state of the European Union, with a population of nearly 60 million. Its capital and largest city is Rome.
    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>Ancient Rome</h3>
    <p>Ancient Rome, a settlement around a ford on the River Tiber in central Italy and founded in 753 BC, according to tradition, was ruled for a period of 244 years by a monarchical system, initially by sovereigns of Latin and Sabine origin, later by Etruscan kings. This tradition enumerated seven kings: Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius, and Tarquinius Superbus. In 509 BC, the Romans, favouring a government of the Senate and the People (SPQR), expelled the monarchy from their city and established an oligarchic republic.</p>
    <h3>Middle Ages</h3>
    <p>After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Italy fell under the power of Odoacer's kingdom, and later was seized by the Ostrogoths, which was followed by a brief reconquest under Byzantine Emperor Justinian in the 6th century. Invasions of the peninsula resulted in a chaotic succession of barbarian kingdoms and the supposed "dark ages". The invasion of another Germanic tribe, the Lombards, late in the same century, reduced the Byzantine presence to the rump realm of the Exarchate of Ravenna and ended political unity of the peninsula for the next 1,300 years. The peninsula was therefore divided into northern Italy and Tuscany forming the Lombard kingdom, with its capital in Pavia, and central-southern Italy, including the duchies of Spoleto and Benevento, controlled by the Lombards. The remaining part of the peninsula remained under the Byzantines and was divided between the exarchate of Italy, based in Ravenna, the Duchy of Rome, the Duchy of Naples, the Duchy of Calabria, and Sicily, the latter being directly dependent on the emperor at Constantinople.</p>
